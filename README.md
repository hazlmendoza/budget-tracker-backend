## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the `budget-tracker-backend` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hazlmendoza/budget-tracker-backend.git
cd budget-tracker-backend
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.example` (if provided, otherwise create manually). This file will store your environment variables.

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/budgetdb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

*   `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
*   `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
*   `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, secret key for signing JWTs.
*   `CORS_ORIGIN`: The URL of your frontend application to allow CORS requests.

### Running the Server

Start the development server using `nodemon` for automatic restarts on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified `PORT`).


## üí° Usage Examples

The backend exposes a RESTful API for managing budget data. Here are some basic examples of how to interact with it.

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1` (adjust based on your `PORT` configuration)

### Register a User

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

### Log In a User

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```
*Response will include a JWT token in the `Authorization` header or body.*

### Create a New Transaction

After logging in, use the received JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

```http
POST /api/v1/transactions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>

{
  "description": "Groceries at SuperMart",
  "amount": 55.75,
  "type": "expense",
  "category": "Food",
  "date": "2023-10-26T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Get All Transactions for a User

```http
GET /api/v1/transactions
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>
```
